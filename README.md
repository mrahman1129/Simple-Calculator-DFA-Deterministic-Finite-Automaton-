# Simple-Calculator-DFA-Deterministic-Finite-Automaton-
Experience the power of deterministic finite automata with Java-based Simple Calculator DFA implementation. This repository presents a robust DFA designed to validate calculator expressions efficiently. It rigorously enforces the rules of calculator syntax, guaranteeing the presence of valid numbers and operators.
